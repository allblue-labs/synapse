# Implementation Status

Last updated: 2026-05-05

## What Is Implemented

### Backend (apps/api)
- NestJS API: auth (register, login, JWT), tenants, users, health, rate limiting, structured JSON logging
- Prisma multi-tenant schema with full index coverage and cascade deletes
- Multi-tenancy guards: `TenantGuard`, `RolesGuard`, `TenantPrismaService`
- Agent CRUD with LLM model config
- Conversation and message CRUD with last-message timestamp atomicity
- Channel abstraction: `ChannelAdapter` interface with Telegram/Discord/WhatsApp adapters
- Knowledge base text search (per-agent + tenant-wide)
- BullMQ queue infrastructure: `message-processing`, `ai-response`, `outbound-message` queues
- LLM pool routing to OpenAI provider
- Prompt builder and structured response parser
- Task dispatch via `TaskEngineService` (local executor)
- Core module system with registry, enable/disable lifecycle
- Messaging registered as first product module (`SynapseModule`)
- **ClinicFlowModule**: REST endpoints (`/v1/clinic-flow/queue`, `/errors`, `/retry`), `ClinicFlowEntry` Prisma model with status FSM, confidence score, extracted data, audit logs
- Runtime architecture with Pain client placeholder
- Docker Compose for Postgres 16, Redis 7, API, Web

### Frontend (apps/web)
- Next.js 15 (App Router) built from scratch with TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- `next-themes`: light / dark / auto (system default)
- `next-intl`: English + Portuguese, locale stored in cookie, no URL prefix
- Top navigation only (no sidebar): Overview + Modules links, theme toggle, locale toggle, sign-out
- Synapse background: animated canvas with thin lines + nodes at very low opacity (blue/neutral)
- Logo (`public/logo.png`) used in nav, login, and landing hero
- Routes:
  - `/` → redirect `/overview`
  - `/overview` — dashboard landing (no charts, module cards, quick actions)
  - `/login` — auth page with Synapse background
  - `/modules` — module grid
  - `/modules/messaging` — messaging module page
  - `/modules/messaging/clinic-flow` — ClinicFlow overview with pipeline diagram
  - `/modules/messaging/clinic-flow/queue` — scheduling queue table with status tabs, detail sheet, approve/reject/edit actions
  - `/modules/messaging/clinic-flow/errors` — failed entries with retry actions
  - `/modules/messaging/clinic-flow/settings` — confidence threshold, auto-approve toggle, calendar webhook
- Middleware: JWT cookie check, redirect to `/login` if unauthenticated
- API client (`lib/api.ts`) with cookie-based JWT bearer injection
- Standalone Docker build mode (`output: 'standalone'`)

## What Is Partially Done

- ClinicFlow backend: endpoints exist but BullMQ worker processor is not yet connected (queue jobs are enqueued but not consumed by a ClinicFlow-specific processor)
- LLM routing: only OpenAI; cost/latency/privacy routing not active
- Queue workers: producers exist, but `message-processing` and `ai-response` processors are stubs
- Pain runtime: stubbed `StubPainClient` — no real Kubernetes reconciliation
- Webhook validation: Telegram has basic validation; Discord + WhatsApp throw `ServiceUnavailable`
- Billing: `BillingAccount` schema exists; Stripe webhooks and subscription lifecycle not wired

## What Is Missing

- ClinicFlow audio → transcription pipeline (Whisper / cloud STT integration)
- ClinicFlow calendar webhook dispatcher (Google Calendar / CalDAV)
- BullMQ worker processors for `ai-response` and `clinic-flow` queues
- Stripe billing integration (plans: Starter, Pro, Credits)
- Production webhook HMAC validation for Discord and WhatsApp
- Metrics/tracing export (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry)
- Kubernetes worker strategy for Pain integration

## Technical Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| LLM cost at scale | LLM pool ready for routing by cost; implement multi-provider in Phase 3 |
| Queue backpressure | BullMQ exponential backoff configured; concurrency limits TBD |
| Cross-tenant data leak | `TenantPrismaService` wraps all queries; guards on all routes |
| Webhook replay attacks | `x-request-id` logged; HMAC validation required before production |
| JWT expiry | 15m expiry configured; refresh token flow not yet implemented |
